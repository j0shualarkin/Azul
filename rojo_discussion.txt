    When we started the project we searched for previous work done with Azul and
artificial intelligence. There we stumbled across discussion of Monte Carlo Tree Search, 
neural network approaches, and the Rojo AI. The Rojo AI is an implementation of the game
in JavaScript, along with a function that chooses the best move for a player.
We implemented our AI in a really good programming language: Racket.
We made a Racket implementation of the Rojo move picker in order to test our
own AI against another one.
