          proximity to bonus --> 
          5 of a color = +15
          4 of a color = +10, 3 = +7, 2 = +4, 1 = +1
          in a row? in a column?
          full stage lines -->  
             compute what the score would be if those tiles were placed
          non-empty stage lines --> 
          empty stage lines --> what colors are placed for those rows?
          are the colors not placed available? 
          these are points for potential scores
